            <h2 class="type">Report</h2>
            <p>Abstract:<br/>
                Our project is an investigation on the nature of neural networks in the wider context of
                artificial intelligence and on its inner workings in image recognition technology. We described,
                analyzed and tested two methods we used to train neural networks specifically for numbers’ images
                recognition: back propagation and genetic algorithms. In our report you will find a detailed
                mathematical and conceptual description of what is artificial intelligence in general and what
                constitutes a neural network more specifically. While there are many more ways to train neural
                networks, we only explain in our report the mathematics and functioning behind back propagation
                and genetic algorithms. Since we have put into practice both training methods by programming our
                own neural networks with Python, the report includes our resultsfor the efficiency of both methods.

            <p>Strange House is a puzzle game developed with python. The game was designed for the command line. The 
                game’s goal? To escape. To do so, the player needs to solve different puzzles presented as codes the 
                player needs to find. All the clues are provided through the player’s interaction. With various commands, 
                the player navigates through different rooms and interact with its environment to find clues and objects.<br/>

            <h2 class="type">HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Web design</h2>
            <p>I created my personal from scratch to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is my first web page to be completed 
                and published. Before this one, I did a small web page designed as a cheat sheet for HTML and CSS content. 
                However, since the page’s content was taken elsewhere, the page couldn’t be published. Thus, the project was 
                abandoned. As I learned more, I added new features to the page and redesigned it to make it more interactive 
                and responsive. I also decided to optimize it for mobile so it could be accessible from everywhere. This page 
                is always changing, as it is used to showcase my skills both by it’s content and it’s design.</p>

            <h2 class="type">HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Web design</h2>
            <p>For a class project, Unus, a team of five students, created a web page to showcase an imaginary product: miRide. The
                site's purpose was to convince future clients to download miRide through the page's design and -made up- arguments.
                Throughout the project, our team had to have great communication to coordinate the web page's development as well
                as great teamwork to help each other out, depending on everyone's strength and weaknesses.
